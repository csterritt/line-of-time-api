    - Monospaced
    - Styled as (say) 1.25 rem
    - Less than ’N’ year(s) - months shown
    - Less than ’M’ year(s) - month and day shown
  - Event brackets
    - SVG lines that go from each event’s center up to its start date, down to its end date
    - So event is in the middle?
    - Lines are various pastels, check for red-green-blindness at least colors
    - Mouseover or tap on an event changes its bracket to white (in dark mode) or black (in light mode)
  - Event name and description fragment
    - One line, not name above description like now
    - Exact same 1.25 rem styling, should line up
- Plus sign in circle to its right, floats to either center of timeline or center of displayed area, clicking it makes a search panel to this panel’s immediate right, disappears once there is a panel
- Panels past the left-most one have an ‘X’ in a circle to close that panel
