If you look at the "git diff" for the changed tests, you'll see that the routes going to /ui are not showing any 'successfully signed in' or other messages. For example, e2e-tests/profile/02-can-change-password.spec.ts used to have "await verifyAlert(page, 'Welcome! You have been signed in successfully.')" Please fix this.
